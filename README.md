# SMU-Homework-04-Code-Quiz

Create a password generator using JavaScript. I made a few tweaks to the initial frame provided, mainly in my use of a dedicated settings button. This allows for better organization of the data gathering portion, as well as the ability to much more quickly generate passwords allowing the user to choose one he/she likes. I also changed the colors. :)
